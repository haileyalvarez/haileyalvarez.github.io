      <p>Hello! My name is Hailey Alvarez, I graduated Texas A&M with a bachelors of science in Visualization.
        I have been in animation since 2015 but took a break while attending Blinn College from 2018-2020. </p>
        <p>Although I have skills to work every part of the animation pipeline,
        I have a love and passion for CFX(Character FX artist). This love is new and I know I definetely
        have a lot to learn. Currently, I have some experience with cloth simulations and hair grooms. One project was
        dedicated to learning and diving into cloth and hair. In that project, I created a final product of a historial viking women
        wearing a wool cape and dress.</p>
      <p>I currently live with my family in College Station(including my 2 dogs). As for the future, I am open to work
        anywhere and any part of the pipeline.
      </p>
